# Week-1
Developing an AI-based image classification model that can identify whether waste items are recyclable or non-recyclable. This helps in automating waste segregation, supporting sustainable waste management and recycling efforts.
Dataset Used: TrashNet Dataset (Kaggle)
# Dataset
This dataset includes images of six waste categories:
Cardboard
Glass
Metal
Paper
Plastic
Trash
The dataset was uploaded and extracted inside Google Colab for use in model training.

# Model
Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
Input image size: 128 × 128 RGB.
Layers included convolution, pooling, flattening, and dense layers.
The final output layer uses softmax activation for six classes.
At this stage, the model architecture has been successfully built and verified.
Training and evaluation will be completed in the next phase.

# Tools & Technologies
Google Colab
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy, Matplotlib

# Model File

The trained model (waste_classifier.h5) was not uploaded because of GitHub’s 25 MB file size limit.
It will be stored locally and can be recreated later once training is completed.

# Project Theme

Sustainability × AI/ML — Promoting responsible waste segregation using artificial intelligence.
